# OS.js on Vagrant

A [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) file is also included so you can easily set up a development or testing environment in a Virtual Machine.

Just use [this configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/master/Vagrantfile).

```shell
$ vagrant up
```
