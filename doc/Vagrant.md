# OS.js on Vagrant

A [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) file is also included so you can easily set up a development or testing environment in a Virtual Machine.

Just use [this configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/os-js/OS.js/master/Vagrantfile).

```shell
$ vagrant up
```

When you have started the image, simply navigate to [http://IP:8000](http://IP:8000) (port 8000 is default).
