OS.js is a desktop implementation for your browser with a fully-fletched window manager, Application APIs, GUI toolkits and filesystem abstraction.

Works in any modern browser and can be deployed on any server using Node or PHP (Windows requries cygwin).

You can read more on [the official homepage](http://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2/)

Current version: [Alpha](https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/wiki/Current-Version)

## Demo

I have a demo running on my server: http://osjsv2.0o.no
