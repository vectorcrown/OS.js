# Setting up the development environment

To get started you need a [Github](https://github.com/) account.

## Prepare

Then proceed to **fork** OS.js via the official [project page](https://github.com/os-js/OS.js).

Follow the official documentation on how to [install and run OS.js](https://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-install.html), with one exception -- run the development server instead:

```
./bin/start-node-dev.sh
```

## Making and submitting changes

* Fork OS.js on github
* Follow the [style guide](https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/wiki/Style-guide)
* Use **UTF-8** file encoding
* I **strongly** recommend using a separate branch for your changes.
* I **strongly** recommend [squashing](http://makandracards.com/makandra/527-squash-several-git-commits-into-a-single-commit) your commits if you have spread out a task into several pieces.
* Make sure you test **all your changes** before commiting so it does not lead to extra commits with corrections.
* Keep your [commit messages](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message) as short as possible and don't include filenames. Write a short description of **what was done**, not *where*. Example: "Themes: Corrected colors" or "Locales: Added ru_RU locales"
* Send a [pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) when you are done
* Keep your fork [up-to-date](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/keeping-a-github-fork-updated) 

Tip: Have `grunt watch` running in the background to automatically run tasks for you when something changes.

Tip: Run `grunt jscs jshint` to check for syntax problems and style guide violations

Tip: Run `grunt mochaTest` to run server-side checks

Tip: Run `grunt test` to test everything

**NOTE THAT I DO NOT ACCEPT PULL-REQUESTS THAT DO NOT FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES ABOVE (AS OF 2016)**
