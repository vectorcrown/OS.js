# Setting up development Environment

To get started you need a [Github](https://github.com/) account.

Then proceed to **fork** OS.js via the official [project page](https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2).

## Prepare


```
# Clone your newly created repository (*git*) and build:

sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt

# Start the server and test if everything is working:

./bin/start-node-dev.sh
```

## Making and submitting changes

Commit the changes to your repository and push changes like normal. You can use `grunt watch` to automatically run tasks when you change files.

When you're done with the changes and want to submit your work, head over to the [pull request page](https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/pulls) and click "New pull request".

*Please note that you don't have to create a new pull-request if you make new changes to the branch you specified, github will update automatically*
