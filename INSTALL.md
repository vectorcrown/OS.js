# Installation instructions

Installation is done in a few simple steps and only takes a minute to get running.

It is highly recommended that you use `git` to install instead of downloading an archive.

## Dependencies

The only requirement is that you have `node` and `npm` installed (v4 or newer).

*Note for Debian/Ubuntu users*: You might need to install the `nodejs-legacy` package.

## Installation

Inside the OS.js directory:

```
$ npm install --production
$ node osjs build
$ node osjs run
```

For more information, see the [Installation Manual](https://os-js.org/manual/installation/).
