# Installation instructions

Server runs on Linux, OS X, BSD and Windows.

Installation is done in a few simple steps and only takes a minute to get running.

For more general information look at the [README](README.md) file or in the [official documentation](http://os.js.org/doc/).

I have also made a [simplified installation guide](http://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-install.html) so you don't have to read this entire thing.

# Dependencies

You just need **node** and **npm**. Install them with your package manager or download the [official installer](https://nodejs.org).

**Debian\Ubuntu:** Also install package `nodejs-legacy`.

# Installation

To easily apply updates and other changes, I recommend using **git** to download instead of using a zip-file/automated installer.

## NIX

### Automated

Run `curl -sS http://os.js.org/installer | sh`.

### Manual

```shell
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

# You can also download and extarct the latest zip
$ git clone https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2.git
$ cd OS.js-v2
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

## Windows

### Automated

Download and run http://os.js.org/installer.exe.

### Manual

Run `cmd` as *Administrator* (important)!

```shell
$ npm install -g grunt-cli

# You can also download and extarct the latest zip
$ git clone https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2.git
$ cd OS.js-v2
$ npm install

# This is required to make the Development Environment work, but is optional.
$ bin\create-windows-symlinks

$ grunt --force
```

## Containers and Virtual Machines

### Vagrant

A [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) file is also included so you can easily set up a development or testing environment in a Virtual Machine.

Just use [this configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/master/Vagrantfile).

```shell
$ vagrant up
```

### Docker

You can also use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to set up an environment.

You can grab a configuration from the [community repo](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/junland/osjs-dev/) 
(you can also find detailed instructions here), or generate one yourself with `./bin/build-docker-image.sh`.

## NW.js

See [NW.md](https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/doc/NW.md).

## X11

OS.js can run as a *X11* Desktop.

See [X11.md](https://github.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/blob/master/doc/X11.md).

# Setting up a server and running

Make sure the _VFS_ directories in `vfs/` are given the same permissions as the web-servers running user.

After you have started a server, simply navigate to http://localhost:8000 (port 8000 is default).

## Node

If you have *node supervisor* intalled the server will automatically make use of it.

* Production: `./bin/start-dist.sh` or `bin\win-start-dist`
* Developement: `./bin/start-dev.sh` or `bin\win-start-dev`

You can install [node supervisor](https://github.com/petruisfan/node-supervisor) and the development (dist-dev) server will automatically reload on change.

## PHP5

You can start a server manually with `(cd dist; php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 ../src/server/php/server.php)` or use look below for webserver alternatives.

If you have a "webhost" (or "webhotel") with ex. cPanel without shell access (or no node support), you can run OS.js, but has to be built on another computer, then transfered over to the target machine. The only downside here is that you'd have to run from /OS.js-v2/dist/ without doing modifications to the setup (if you don't have access to mod_rewrite to create proxy rules).

### Apache

Run `grunt apache-vhost` to generate config file (or look in doc/ for example)

*Note* You have to enable mod_rewrite for Apache and make sure htaccess is allowed.

### Lighttpd

Run `grunt lighttpd-config` to generate config file (or look in doc/ for example)

### Nginx

Run `grunt nginx-config` to generate config file (or look in doc/ for example)

### WAMP

Works fine. Just look up the Apache section above for configuration.

# Setting up optional features
